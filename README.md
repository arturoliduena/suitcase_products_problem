You work as a salesperson in a jewelry firm. The most important trade fair in the sector is taking
place soon in a far away country, and you have to prepare for the event. There are n products that
you would be interested in showing in the fair. However, due to several restrictions it is not possible
to take them all. Since your firm has paid the cheapest airfare for the flight, first of all there is a strict
limit on the dimensions of the luggage. Fortunately you have a suitcase that fits exactly. The suitcase
has a rectangular shape with height x and width y, measured in millimetres. Products come in square
boxes, which, because of the fragility of the merchandise, cannot be put in the suitcase one on top
of the other. Also, to avoid that products move inside uncontrollably, there is a system of inner rails
that require that boxes are placed with their sides parallel to the sides of the suitcase. Apart from
the geometrical constraints, the total weight of the suitcase cannot exceed c grams. Finally, you think
it would be convenient to take with you the most expensive and luxurious products, as you expect
these could attract potential customers. How should you choose the products so as to maximize the
accumulated price, while respecting the travelling constraints?
